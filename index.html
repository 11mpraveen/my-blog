        <p>My name is Manasa and my favorite hobby is reasing book. Reading books is my favorite hobby because when you read books it takes you into another world. I know that reading is a good habit because when you can read you can learn many things. My favorite book series is Percy Jackson and Olympians. It is my favorite book series because it is so detailed and throughly written. If you pick the book up it seems as if you can never put it down. The books take me to another world which I never want to leave. </p>
